# **Enhance the Weekly Time Allocation App with Local Cache + Editable DB Entries: Exhaustive Step-by-Step Checklist**

Below is a precise, step-by-step checklist in Markdown form explaining exactly how to add a local cache, ensure existing (previous) submissions are loaded/updated from Cosmos DB, and unify the dashboard data. An autonomous AI coding agent can follow these to the letter.

---

1. **Create a Cache Manager for Time Entries**  
   - [ ] In the project root, create a file named `cacheManager.js`.  
   - [ ] Populate `cacheManager.js` with the following content (adjust if needed):
     ```js
     // cacheManager.js
     const timeEntriesCache = {};

     function setEntriesForWeek(weekKey, entries) {
       timeEntriesCache[weekKey] = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(entries));
     }

     function getEntriesForWeek(weekKey) {
       if (!timeEntriesCache[weekKey]) return undefined;
       return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(timeEntriesCache[weekKey]));
     }

     function getAllKeys() {
       return Object.keys(timeEntriesCache);
     }

     function clearCache(weekKey) {
       if (weekKey) {
         delete timeEntriesCache[weekKey];
       } else {
         for (const k in timeEntriesCache) {
           delete timeEntriesCache[k];
         }
       }
     }

     module.exports = {
       setEntriesForWeek,
       getEntriesForWeek,
       getAllKeys,
       clearCache
     };
     ```

2. **Include `cacheManager.js` in `index.html` or `index.js`**  
   - [ ] In `index.html`, **before** `<script src="index.js"></script>`, add:
     ```html
     <script src="cacheManager.js"></script>
     ```
     This ensures `window.cacheManager` is available when `index.js` runs.

3. **Use the Cache in `index.js` Instead of the `previousSubmissions` Object**  
   - [ ] Locate any `let previousSubmissions = {};` in `index.js` and remove it.  
   - [ ] After that, reference the cache manager, e.g.:
     ```js
     const { setEntriesForWeek, getEntriesForWeek, getAllKeys } = window.cacheManager;
     ```
   - [ ] In places where code assigns `previousSubmissions[weekKey] = ...`, replace with:
     ```js
     setEntriesForWeek(weekKey, entries);
     ```
   - [ ] In places checking `if (previousSubmissions[weekKey]) { ... }`, replace with:
     ```js
     const existing = getEntriesForWeek(weekKey);
     if (existing) {
       entries = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(existing));
       isSubmitted = true;
     } else {
       isSubmitted = false;
     }
     ```
4. **After Fetching Time Entries, Save to Cache**  
   - [ ] In the function `fetchTimeEntriesForCurrentWeek()`, after obtaining `data` for that week, do:
     ```js
     const weekKey = formatWeekRange(currentWeek);
     setEntriesForWeek(weekKey, entries);
     ```
     so it’s stored in the local cache.

5. **Ensure `submitTimesheet()` Overwrites Cache**  
   - [ ] In `submitTimesheet()` (near the code that calls `saveTimeEntriesToApi`), after a successful response, do:
     ```js
     const weekKey = formatWeekRange(currentWeek);
     setEntriesForWeek(weekKey, entries);
     ```
   - [ ] That ensures the local cache is updated, matching the DB.

6. **Adjust the Dashboard to Pull from Cache**  
   - [ ] In the `processProjectData()` function (or wherever the dashboard logic collects existing submissions), replace:
     ```js
     const submissionWeeks = Object.keys(previousSubmissions);
     ```
     with:
     ```js
     const submissionWeeks = getAllKeys(); 
     ```
   - [ ] Whenever reading `previousSubmissions[week]`, switch to:
     ```js
     const weekEntries = getEntriesForWeek(week) || [];
     ``` 
   - [ ] This ensures the charts use the same data loaded from the DB and stored in the cache.

7. **Confirm DB Code for Updating**  
   - [ ] Open `api/saveTimeEntry/index.js` and verify it checks for an existing doc by week, then replaces it if found, or creates new if not. This is already in place.  
   - [ ] No changes are needed if it’s functioning as expected.

8. **(Optional) Clear Cache on Logout**  
   - [ ] If desired, create a function like `function clearLocalCache() { window.cacheManager.clearCache(); }` in `index.js`, and call it on a hypothetical logout step. This is optional.

9. **Build the Project**  
   - [ ] In the root directory (where `package.json` is), run:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - [ ] Ensure the build completes successfully.  

10. **Append a One-Sentence Summary to `.cursor-updates`**  
   - [ ] At the end of `.cursor-updates` file, add something like:  
     ```
     Implement local caching for previously submitted data, unify reading/updating from Cosmos DB
     ```
   - [ ] Stage and commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Implement local caching for time entries, unify DB read/update, fix dashboard data usage"
     ```

With these steps, the Weekly Time Allocation app now has a local cache, loads and updates previous submissions from Cosmos DB, and uses that same data for the dashboard charts.
